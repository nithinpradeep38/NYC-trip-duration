# NYC-trip-duration
Predict the duration of cab trips in NYC based on the 2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data.
The data was originally published by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).

There are two files. In the EDA file, we do the exploratory data analysis along with some feature engineering.
In the prediction file, we test two algorithms- XGBoost and RandomForestRegressor to predict the time duration of taxi trips in New York.
